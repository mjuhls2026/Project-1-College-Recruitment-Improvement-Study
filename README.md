# Project-1

#### The purpose of this project is to use a dataset to answer questions about how CCM can increase the number of students taking computing courses at the college.
#### There are 2 csv files in the repository, one of the original dataset of students who are a technology major and the other is the cleaned version of that csv
#### Another is a file the notebook file that created the cleaned_majors.csv file, but when I initially saved the work I forgot to add the .ipynb extension when saving, and I realized that afterwards when saving the new file.
#### The last file is the Project1P3 file and that includes 2 graphs, a bar graph showing ways students heard about ccm, and a pie chart of students ratings of the tech courses they took. There is also some comments that answer questions 3 and 4, "Is there a positive correlation between attending tech events and taking tech courses?" and "Is there a noticeable correlation between attending students and CCM materials (Pamphlets, emails, advertisements, etc.) received?"
